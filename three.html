            <hr>
            <p>Oh boy! Dessert! Anybody, and everybody, know that I might just have the most giant sweet tooth to exist on the planet. I could literally have eaten an entire five-course meal, but the second a piece of sugar is put in front of me, It'll be
                gone in seconds (or as my younger brother says, "there 's always room for dessert, the stomach knows and opens up the special "piston" for it"). Fun dessert fact: The world's largest gingerbread house topped out at 2,520 square feet and
                contained 35.8 million calories. God, I would do anything to be in that house. Back to recipes, though, desserts have a special place in my heart because they are how I show people I love them. Every Friday night, I remember my sister
                and me would sit in the kitchen for hours mixing ingredients for our next surprise dessert. It 's a place where you're creativity takes over. Below are some of my favourite recipes. </p>

            <h1>Chef Style</h1>
            <h2>1. Coffee Crème Brûlée, Cheryl Slocum
            </h2>
            <img src="images/3a.jpg">

            <p>
                I have never made Crème Brulee, aka. burned cream, before trying out this recipe, if you are like me venturing into the unknown and stretching yourself... don't be intimidated! It is pretty simple and well worth it. The flavour of coffee is not a reason
                to shy away from this recipe, as it adds a subtly bitter taste to help counteract the sweetness, creating the perfect balance. This recipe doesn't call for that signature caramel topping on top of the hardened shell, as I found it just
                to become too overpowering in terms of sweetness. However, if your heart desires the caramel dressing, I found reducing the light brown sugar to a quarter cup and making the drizzle helps combat the overpowering sweetness. This recipe
                does call for a longer bake time (about three and a half hours). However, a good chunk of that is "inactive" time. *Tip: If you find they come out of the oven a little runny, toss them back in there for 3-minute intervals. It should have
                a solid yet light bounce to it.

            </p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    1/2 cup light brown sugar

                </li>
                <li>
                    3 cups heavy cream
                </li>
                <li>
                    3/4 cup dark-roast coffee beans

                </li>
                <li>
                    1 vanilla bean
                </li>
                <li>
                    6 large egg yolks

                </li>
                <li>
                    1/2 cup granulated sugar

                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Line parchment paper and spread the brown sugar into an even layer. Set aside for two hours, until the sugar dries out slightly.

                </li>
                <li>
                    In a medium pot over medium heat, bring the cream, coffee beans, vanilla bean pod, and seeds to a boil. Once reached to a boil, immediately turn off the heat and allow the mixture to sit at room temperature for at least an hour. Remove and discard any
                    solids in the mix.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.

                </li>
                <li>
                    In a large pot over high heat, boil water. Why the water is boiling in a large bowl, whisk yolks with granulated sugar until it forms a thick and pale yellow mixture.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in the cold cream with the mixture created in Step 4.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Prep 6 ovenproof bowls by evenly dividing the custard mixture among them, allowing the liquid to settle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transfer the bowls to a pan. Pour hot water into the pan until it reaches about halfway up the bowls.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake for about 35 minutes until the custard has set.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Transfer to a wire rack and let cool in the fridge for about 2 hours.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Sift the brown sugar in a small bowl. Preheat the broiler and remove the bolts from the fridge, placing them on a baking sheet. Sprinkle a tablespoon of brown sugar on top of each Bowl. Place the balls back into the broiler until the sugar is ground,
                    about 1 to 2 minutes. Allow the bowls to cool, hardening the top. Serve immediately.

            <h1>Restaurant Style</h1>
            <h2>2. Sticky Toffee Banana Cake, Calm Cuisine
            </h2>
            <img src="images/3b-copy.jpeg">
            <p>
                Calm Cuisine has always been a personal favourite of mine. You can genuinely tell they put a lot of effort and thought into every single one of their recipes. They started of as a single chef in the restaurant business but left that life behind to share
                their recipes with us (thank you, Jenn!). “The recipes on my page reflect my life; as a mom, I need easy meals the whole family will enjoy, but the chef in me needs to eat too!” -Calm Cuisine. This recipe is one to save. It’s a family
                favourite at my house, and although the ingredient list may seem daunting, it is a lot easier than many other cake recipes you will find alone. I also love the versatility with this recipe, as you can add any topping of your choice afterwards,
                and it will taste just as delicious. The stickiness of the toffee, combined with the warmth of the cake, is the ultimate duo. <br><br>*Tip: The toffee sauce can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill, then rewarm slightly
                before using.

            </p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

                <li>
                    Pinch of salt
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Butter and flour, or add cooking spray to an 8 by 8-inch baking sheet.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Using a hand mixture or electric mixture, place the melted butter and sugar together and blend until combined. Are the eggs, mashed bananas, lemon juice, and vanilla extract into the mixture afterwards. Slowly stir in the flour mixture into the wet mix
                    until Incorporated. Do not overmix. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 35 minutes.

                </li>
                <li>


                    To make the sauce, bring the heavy cream, brown sugar, corn syrup, butter, and salt to a boil over a heavy small saucepan over high heat, continuously whisking until the sugar has completely dissolved. Reduce the heat to medium and bring the mixture into
                    a gentle boil, occasionally whisking until the mixture becomes thickened.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Place the toffee sauce over the baked banana cake and return the cake into the oven until the sauce becomes bubbly, for about 6 minutes. Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool on a wire rack completely.

            <h2>3. Apple Crisp, Jen Segal
            </h2>
            <img src="images/3c-copy.jpeg">
            <p>
                Jenn has always been a personal favourite. She was my go-to chef and baker when I first started getting into baking. Her recipes are always so well thought out, and you can feel her passion and love through her recipes. This apple crisp recipe is to die
                for. I remember making it with my mother on a warm autumn day. It was my first “big girl” recipe (something besides those cookies that are premade in a package, and all that is required is to place them in the oven). The simplicity behind
                such an elegant recipe left me awe-struck ever since. I enjoy topping mine off with vanilla ice cream; the contrasting temperatures from the two play together nicely. However, even just alone, the toasted, slightly sweetened apples alongside
                just the most mouth-watering oat mixture will sure leave you wanting more. You can also prep the oat and apple mixture the day before and leave in the fridge, just add a small amount of lemon juice to the apples to prevent them from browning.
                <br><br>*Tip: If you prefer to use gluten-free flour or any substitute, it works just as fine!

            </p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp. all-purpose flour

                </li>
                <li>
                    1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp. light brown sugar, packed

                </li>
                <li>
                    1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp. granulated sugar, divided

                </li>
                <li>
                    Pinch salt

                </li>
                <li>
                    6 tablespoons very cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch dice

                </li>
                <li>
                    1 cup chopped pecans

                </li>
                <li>
                    1/2 cup old-fashioned rolled oats

                </li>
                <li>
                    2-1/2 pounds tart baking apples (about 5 large), peeled, cored and sliced 1/4-inch thick

                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

                </li>
                <li>
                    In a food processor, combine the flour with the brown sugar and a quarter cup of the granulated sugar and salt until well combined. Add the butter into the mixture and continue to pulse until merged. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and stir in the pecans
                    and oats.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Butter a shallow 2-quart baking dish. In a bowl, toss the apples with the remaining granulated sugar. Transfer the apple and sugar mixture into the prepared baking dish and add the oat topping on top from Step 1—Bake in the oven for 40 to 50 minutes.
